#Every python program, or automation program needs to have a __init__.py file
#This file is used to initialize the module, and for the interpreter to know 
#that this is a module

#It is important that as IT Specialists, we should know how to use different IDEs,
# and Code Editors. This is because we will be working with different teams.
# Code Editors such as Atom, Notepad++, Sublime Text, Eclipse, and Pycharm.
# CLIs such as Vim, Emacs, and Nano.
